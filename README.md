## CENG 463 - Introduction to Machine Learning


#### Homework 1: Regression Techniques (Due: 10.11.2024)
- [x] **Task 1: Data Loading and Exploratory Data Analysis**
  - Load the heart disease dataset.
  - Identify features and target variables.
  - Check for missing values and display dataset insights.

- [x] **Task 2: Correlation Analysis**
  - Compute Pearson correlation.
  - Filter and identify the most correlated features.

- [x] **Task 3: Simple Linear Regression**
  - Implement simple linear regression manually.
  - Calculate coefficients, make predictions, and visualize results.

- [x] **Task 4: Multiple Linear Regression**
  - Train a multiple linear regression model using top correlated features.
  - Calculate MSE and compare actual vs. predicted values.

- [x] **Task 5: Logistic Regression**
  - Train and evaluate a logistic regression model using scikit-learn.

- [x] **Task 6: Polynomial Regression**
  - Use PolynomialFeatures to train and evaluate the model.
  - Calculate MSE and visualize results.

- [x] **Performance Comparison**
  - Compare performance metrics for all models in a table.

- [x] **Task 2: Model Implementation and Evaluation**
  - **Support Vector Machine (SVM):** 
    - Train and evaluate the model.
    - Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score.
  - **Na√Øve Bayes:** 
    - Train and evaluate the model.
    - Calculate precision, recall, and F1-score.
